# AIUB Buddy Ride - Student Signup Guide

## How to Sign Up

### Step 1: Use Your AIUB Student Email

- Go to the Buddy Ride application
- Click "Sign Up"
- Enter your official AIUB student email in this format: `XX-XXXXX-X@student.aiub.edu`
- Example: `23-51455-1@student.aiub.edu`

### Step 2: Create Password

- Choose a secure password (minimum 6 characters)
- Click "Create Account"

### Step 3: Automatic Profile Creation

- ✅ Your student ID will be **automatically extracted** from your email
- ✅ A basic profile will be created for you
- ✅ No manual entry of student ID required!

### Step 4: Complete Your Profile

- After email verification, you'll be prompted to complete your profile
- Fill in your full name
- Select your department
- Choose your gender
- Your student ID will already be filled in (you can update it if needed)

## Email Format Requirements

### ✅ Correct Format

- `23-51455-1@student.aiub.edu`
- `22-99999-9@student.aiub.edu`
- `24-12345-6@student.aiub.edu`

### ❌ Incorrect Format

- `invalid@student.aiub.edu` (not a valid student ID)
- `23-51455-1@gmail.com` (not AIUB domain)
- `2351455@student.aiub.edu` (missing dashes)

## What Happens Automatically

1. **Email Validation**: System checks for @student.aiub.edu domain
2. **Student ID Extraction**: Your ID is extracted from email address
3. **Format Validation**: System validates XX-XXXXX-X pattern
4. **Profile Creation**: Basic profile created with your student ID
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: System prevents duplicate student IDs

## If You Have Issues

### Temporary Student ID

- If your email doesn't match the exact format, you'll get a temporary ID like `99-00001-25`
- You can update this to your real student ID in profile setup

### Duplicate Student ID Error

- If someone already has your student ID, contact admin
- This should be rare due to automatic extraction

### Invalid Email Format

- Make sure your email follows the exact pattern: `XX-XXXXX-X@student.aiub.edu`
- Contact your academic department if you don't have a proper AIUB email

## Admin Contact

- Admin email: `00-00000-0@student.aiub.edu`
